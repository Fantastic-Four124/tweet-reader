#tweet-reader

##A prototype for MongoDB services in Ruby and Sinatra
___
###Basic

This is the bare-bones assembly for a service using the MongoDB, utilizing the *mongoid* gem and the resource *mLab*.

The intent is for this to become the reading service for Tweets for the accompanying nanoTwitter application. As such, it is designed to retrieve Tweets.

It will probably need to have the Redis cache, or whatever we need to handle reads more effectively.
